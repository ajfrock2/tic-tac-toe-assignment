/*Spent a bit of time anaylzing the pre-exisitng code trying to figure out how it all worked.
//Anything I didn't understand, ChatGPT helped explained
//Coded one function at a time, checking each one worked before moving on to the next.
//Fed my 1st iteration code to ChatGPT to identify any potential bugs, fixed them
//Spent 2 hours bugfixing only to realize that I was not loading the .png files correctly
//Hung out in office hours for around 20 minutes
