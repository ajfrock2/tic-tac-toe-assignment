## Part 1
Spent a bit of time anaylzing the pre-exisitng code trying to figure out how it all worked.

Anything I didn't understand, ChatGPT helped explained

Coded one function at a time, checking each one worked before moving on to the next.

Fed my 1st iteration code to ChatGPT to identify any potential bugs, fixed them

Spent 2 hours bugfixing only to realize that I was not loading the .png files correctly

Hung out in office hours for around 20 minutes

## Part 2
Followed most everything that was done in class.

Didn't follow everything so my AI was pretty stupid.

Had to learn minmax/negamax in depth to actually understand the code.

Used that knowledge to find the bugs and then had myself a working AI.

I can no longer beat it, so I think it's doing everything right.
